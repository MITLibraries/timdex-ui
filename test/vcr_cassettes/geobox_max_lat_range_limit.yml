        was flown in May 1996 at a height of approximately three miles, resulting
        in a photo scale of 1:31,680 and a digital orthophoto resolution of one meter
        pixels. Ayres Associates digitized all hydrography features and provided this
        data as a two-dimensional AutoCAD drawing file. The data was provided in the
        custom Polk County Coordinate system. In 2006 Polk County converted the AutoCAD
        hydrography file into and ESRI shapefile creating the Hydro96Body file.In
        2012 Polk County used the Wisconsin DNR - WD_HYDRO_DATA_24k.gdb and more specifically
        the WD_HYDRO_FLOWLINE_LN_24k map layer, as a guide to insure DNR location
        and classification of hydro centerlines. The DNR metadata states: (HydroFlowLine
        is the framework of the data set and consists of all arcs in Version 6 release
        coverage HYDNW924 that transport water. HydroFlowLine was created with M (measures)
        and Z (elevation) values to accommodate placement of user data through a linear
        referencing system located on the measure system of transport arcs. Features
        represent blue lines on 1:24,000 scale USGS Topography Quadrangle maps and
        artificial flow through WaterArea and WaterBody features and across land.
        HydroFlowLine serves as the input to the Geometric Network.)The DNR data field
        (HYDROCODE) was added to the layer in order to classify flow type. Many features
        were added or redigitized using the Polk County 2006 or 2010 othrophotography
        at a map scale of approximately 1:1,200. The purposes of this maintenance
        is to improve the current database with names, hydrocode, and centerline location.]"]},{"timdexRecordId":"gisogm:edu.wisc:260f9202d3f1","title":"Hydro
