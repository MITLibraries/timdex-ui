        Available at:  http://purl.stanford.edu/qf389cd0263 IMPORTANT: For correct
        population analysis using ESRI products assure that the following parameters
        are set:- Use ONLY Geographic, WGS84 projection parameters.- Spatial Analysis
        cell size is 0.008333333333333 (double precision)- Spatial Analysis extent
        should be set to an exact multiple of the cell size (for example 35.25, 35.50,
        35.0)Converting (including on-the-fly projections) a grid to other projections
        or coordinate systems causes population cells to be re-sampled, and hence
        population counts will be incorrect.In ESRI ArcMap, load the LandScan grid
        first in order to maintain the original geographic (lat-lon) projection.\"The
        dataset has a spatial resolution of 30 arc-seconds and is output in a geographical
        coordinate system - World Geodetic System (WGS) 84 datum. The 30 arc-second
        cell, or 0.008333333 decimal degrees, represents approximately 1 km2 near
        the equator. Since the data is in a spherical coordinate system, cell width
        decreases in a relationship that varies with the cosine of the latitude of
        the cell. Thus a cell at 60 degrees latitude would have a width that is half
        that of a cell at the equator (cos60 = 0.5). The height of the cells does
        not vary. The values of the cells are integer population counts, not population
        density, since the cells vary in size. Population counts are normalized to
        sum to each sub-national administrative unit estimate. For this reason, projecting
        the data in a raster format to a different coordinate system (including on-the-fly
        projections) will result in a re-sampling of the data and the integrity of
        normalized population counts will be compromised. Also prior to all spatial
        analysis, users should ensure that extents are set to an exact multiple of
        the cell size (for example 35.25, 35.50, 35.0) to avoid ''shifting'' of the

        cell size is 0.008333333333333 (double precision)- Spatial Analysis extent
        should be set to an exact multiple of the cell size (for example 35.25, 35.50,
        35.0)Converting (including on-the-fly projections) a grid to other projections
        or coordinate systems causes population cells to be re-sampled, and hence
        population counts will be incorrect.In ESRI ArcMap, load the LandScan grid
        first in order to maintain the original geographic (lat-lon) projection.\"The
        dataset has a spatial resolution of 30 arc-seconds and is output in a geographical
        coordinate system - World Geodetic System (WGS) 84 datum. The 30 arc-second
        cell, or 0.008333333 decimal degrees, represents approximately 1 km2 near
        the equator. Since the data is in a spherical coordinate system, cell width
        decreases in a relationship that varies with the cosine of the latitude of
        the cell. Thus a cell at 60 degrees latitude would have a width that is half
        that of a cell at the equator (cos60 = 0.5). The height of the cells does
        not vary. The values of the cells are integer population counts, not population
        density, since the cells vary in size. Population counts are normalized to
        sum to each sub-national administrative unit estimate. For this reason, projecting
        the data in a raster format to a different coordinate system (including on-the-fly
        projections) will result in a re-sampling of the data and the integrity of
        normalized population counts will be compromised. Also prior to all spatial
        analysis, users should ensure that extents are set to an exact multiple of
        the cell size (for example 35.25, 35.50, 35.0) to avoid ''shifting'' of the
