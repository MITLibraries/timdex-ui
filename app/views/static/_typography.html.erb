  <p class="copy-lead">Lead copy for making an impact. This should only be used for short swaths of text - no more than a paragraph usually.</p>
  <p class="copy-base">Base copy size and line-height - set up for easy legibility in body copy.</p>
  <p class="copy-sup">Supplementary copy is useful for text that is not the primary focus but is still part of the experience for users.</p>
  <p class="copy-micro">Micro copy is good for legalese and other copy that no one wants to read but may have to post - Be careful with this use as it borders on inaccessible to low-vision users.</p>
